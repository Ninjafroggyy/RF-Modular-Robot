Purpose:
Handle movement commands from the GUI and send them to the robot (via network.py).

Tasks:
1. Define allowed movement commands (forward, backward, left, right, stop)
2. Create function send_movement_command(direction) that:
    - Validates direction
    - Formats it (e.g., JSON or plain string)
    - Sends it via network.send_data(...)
3. Add safety wrapper (e.g., ignore commands if not connected)

Libraries:
None directly (depends on network.py for comms)
